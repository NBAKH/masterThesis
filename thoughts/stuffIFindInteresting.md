#Stuff I find interesting
=====================
I'm trying to make a list of topics, articles and topics in academia I find interesting enough to make it the subject for my master thesis. Initially I have decided to do this in english, but I haven't decided if I should write my thesis paper in danish as I'm far more articulate in my native tongue (surprise).

#Critical Design and the Crisis of Agency
###Types of critical design
The term Critical Design was original coined by Anthony Dunne (and Raby??) which covers a specific design discipline where the goal isn't user-friendlyness but user-unfriendlyness. The good thing with products that are hard to use is that it reveals how we use interaction design. When you create something seamlessly either the user or the designer learns anything about how we understand our society or the usage of technology in it. This unfriendly piece of interaction design is called the post-optimal object.
Since critical design got defined there has been a lot of under-categories and genres. One of them is described in Dunne and Raby's book, Speculative Everything. The main point of the book is, that you can use critical design to predict the future by making design that fits in to a world that possible could be. An example of this is their own design project; Foragers.
