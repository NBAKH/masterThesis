##Stuff I find interesting
I'm trying to make a list of topics, articles and topics in academia I find interesting enough to make it the subject for my master thesis. Initially I have decided to do this in english, but I haven't decided if I should write my thesis paper in danish as I'm far more articulate in my native tongue (surprise).

##Critical Design and the Crisis of Agency

###How do we design the relationship between robots/AIs and humans?

###Mutualistic Systems Design

###City Hacking

###Survaillance

###Terrorism and the terror of the media(western world)

###Bots/AI and the economic singularity

###How and, what makers make and who they inspire.

###Computational art, art installations, and computational activism
